This is to pair each Biome to what Blueprints and Entries can be found there.
BiomeGroup's string DisplayName (Biome Display Name) -> All Blueprint Unlocks and Entries Found (Each one from Subnautica100Checklist.txt) [] = Databank Entries | {} = Blueprints
This is to track what can be found where so you can customize the Biome Tracker.
