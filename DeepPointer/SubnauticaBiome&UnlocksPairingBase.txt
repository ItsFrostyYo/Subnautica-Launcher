This is to pair each Biome to what Blueprints and Entries are found there.
BiomeGroup's string DisplayName (Biome Display Name) -> All Blueprint Unlocks and Entries Found (Each one from Subnautica100Checklist.txt)
This will be for tracking what should be shown for each biome for the Basic Biome Tracker, this is not for the customizable one, this shows what i personally want shown as a baseline, SubnauticaBiome&UnlocksPairing.txt has the information of what can be found in each biome, this is just what i find important.
